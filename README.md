# 1 wire algorithm implementation using UART
A library to communicate with 1 wire device using uart

Development is still in progress..

## Why Uart in 1 wire?
Uart can be implemented in 1 wire protocol easily without going through setting
all the delay. By setting the correct baud rate and bit size a microcontroller
can actually communicate with 1 wire device.

## BaudRate used in communicating
TODO
